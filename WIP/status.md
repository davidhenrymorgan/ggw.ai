Project Status for girlsgonewild.ai
Last Updated: 2025-10-06

## ‚úÖ Deployed & Working

**Foundation:**
- Next.js 15 starter with App Router and Turbopack
- Clerk authentication (sign-up, sign-in, social logins)
- Clerk ‚Üí Convex user sync via webhooks
- Clerk Billing integration with payment webhooks
- Theme provider (light/dark mode with Sora-inspired dark theme)
- TailwindCSS v4 + shadcn/ui components

**UI/UX (Sora/Leonardo-inspired):**
- `/explore` page with filter/sort controls (All/Images/Videos, New/Trending)
- Masonry grid layout using CSS columns
- AssetCard component with glass morphism effects
- Dark canvas theme (oklch 0.08) with subtle borders and glass cards

**Backend Infrastructure:**
- Convex schema: `assets`, `generations`, `likes`, `collections`, `collectionItems` tables
- Cloudflare R2 storage client (S3-compatible API)
- Promptchan API wrapper for image/video generation
- Image generation flow: `createImageGeneration` ‚Üí `processImageGeneration` action
- Convex queries for explore feed with filters/sorting
- R2 integration with custom domain: cloud.girlsgonewild.ai

**Generation UI:**
- `/dashboard/generate` page with multi-mode support
- 4 generation modes: Text-to-Image, Text-to-Video, Image-to-Image, Image Edit
- Image upload component with drag-and-drop
- Quality selectors with dynamic credit cost display
- Style, filter, emotion, and advanced settings controls

## üöß Built But Not Deployed

**Needs Environment Variable Fix:**
- Auth currently failing: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL` not set in Convex
- Once set, full generation flow should work end-to-end

**Backend Ready, Not Tested:**
- Complete image generation workflow (API ‚Üí R2 ‚Üí Convex)
- R2 storage with proper key generation and CDN URL handling
- Asset creation and status tracking

## üîß Partially Working

**Generation Flow:**
- ‚úÖ Frontend forms built and styled
- ‚úÖ Backend mutations/actions implemented
- ‚úÖ R2 client configured with credentials
- ‚úÖ Promptchan API client updated to official spec
- ‚ùå Auth blocking: Need to set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL` in Convex
- ‚è≥ End-to-end testing pending auth fix

**Explore Feed:**
- ‚úÖ UI built and connected to Convex queries
- ‚è≥ No real data yet (waiting for successful generations)

## ‚ùå Known Issues

**Critical (Blocking):**
1. **Auth Error**: Missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL` in Convex environment variables
   - Error: "No auth provider found matching the given token"
   - Fix: Run `npx convex env set NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL https://natural-gazelle-72.clerk.accounts.dev`
   - User is currently upgrading Convex to paid tier

**Infrastructure:**
2. **Convex Free Tier Limits**: Upgrading to paid tier for production usage
3. **Custom Domain**: girlsgonewild.ai configured in Cloudflare but not yet attached to Vercel deployment

**To Test:**
- Full image generation flow (once auth is fixed)
- R2 upload and CDN URL generation
- Asset creation and explore feed population
- Credit cost calculations
- Multi-mode generation (image-to-image, video, etc.)
